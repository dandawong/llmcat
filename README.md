## üöÄ Introduction

LLMCat is a powerful browser extension designed to be your personal, local-first knowledge base for all your interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). It automatically and seamlessly captures your conversations from various AI platforms, storing them securely on your local machine. With LLMCat, you can instantly search, retrieve, and manage your AI-driven insights without ever worrying about losing valuable information or juggling multiple platform histories.

In an era where we increasingly rely on AI for creative, technical, and analytical tasks, our conversations with these models become a valuable asset. However, these dialogues are often scattered across different services, making them difficult to track and leverage. LLMCat solves this problem by creating a unified, searchable archive of your AI interactions, turning ephemeral chats into a persistent and powerful personal knowledge repository.

This tool is built for developers, researchers, writers, students, and anyone who frequently uses AI platforms and wants to maintain a private, organized, and easily accessible record of their digital brainstorming sessions.
